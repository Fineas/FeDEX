      <p>
        Real World CTF, first organized in 2018, has come to be one of the highlights of the year for the CTF community. 
        It tries to prove wrong all the CTF haters (<a href="https://twitter.com/CristiVlad25/status/1313071875036262403">"I hate CTFs because they are not realistic."</a>)
        by building challenges on top of real world applications.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, due to COVID-19, the format was "Online Jeopardy", only, with no Final Stage. However, in previous editions, the final event was simply incredible.
        <br>

      </p>
      <p>
        But anyway, this year, together with my teammates from <a href="http://wrecktheline.com/">WreckTheLine</a> we managed to finish the CTF on #5 which is an incredible performance and great team effort. Really Proud.
      </p>
      <center><img src="assets/img/rwctf7.png"></center><br>
      <p>Enough with the introduction now, let's dive into this amazing challenge...</p>
      <!-- EXPLORATION -->
      <h1><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> <span>&lt;SETUP & RECON&gt;</span></h1>
      <h5 class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mb-3">
        <span class="text-muted">Problem Statement: <span style="color:#ffffff">Qiling as a Service. </span></span>
      </h5>
      <h5 class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mb-3">
        <span class="text-muted">Problem Stats: <span style="color:#ffffff">23 solves, 182pts <code>Clone-and-Pwn</code> <code>difficulty:Schrödinger</code> </span></span>
      </h5>
      <p>
        The challenge provided us with an ip & port <code>nc 47.242.149.197 7600</code>, in order to pwn the task remotely and get the flag, plus an arhcive <a href="#">QLaaS_61a8e641694e10ce360554241bdda977.tar.gz</a>
        . The goal is to run the SUID binary <code>/readflag</code> which will print the file <code>flag</code> .
      </p>
      <p>
        Opening the archive we can see that there's just one small python script:
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <img src="assets/img/rwctf5.PNG">
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          The program is asking us to provide a binary <code>b64</code> encoded. Then, it will proceed to create a temporary directory
          and save our binary inside that folder. After that, a Qiling instance is created, to whom the path to the binary and the temporary folder
          are passed, followed by a call to the <code>run()</code> method.<br><br>
          Another observation we can make from the source code is that the qiling version used is <code>1.4.1</code> (the latest version).<br><br> Alright, now that we know what the script does
          let's take a look and see what <a href="https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling">Qiling</a> is about: <br>
          &nbsp; > "An Advanced Binary Emulation Framework."<br><br>
          This means that the framework is able to emulate a native computer, in an isolated environment. It provides support for Windows, MacOS, Linux, BSD, UEFI, DOS, MBR, Ethereum Virtual Machine. Cool.<br><br>
          Let's have a look at qiling's <a href="https://docs.qiling.io/en/latest/howto/">API</a>.
        </div>
      </div><br>
        <p>
          It turns out that the Qiling constructor is expecting a binary to emulate and a <code>rootfs</code> (sandbox). But then, how will it know what type of 
          binary we've provided? Let's check that in the <a href="https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling/blob/master/qiling/core.py">source code</a>. 
        </p>
        <center><img src="assets/img/rwctf6.PNG"></center><br>
        <p>
          First, it will look for certain file extensions, if they are not provided as part of the filename, then it will look for file signatures (ex. <code>\x7fELF</code>) and determin
          the operating system from that. Great, now we know, that we're allowed to work with any binary from the supported list since no specific <code>ostype</code> is passed to <code>Qiling</code>. 
        </p>
      <!-- DEBUGGING -->
      <h1><i class="fas fa-search"></i><span>&lt;Vulnerability Discovery&gt;</span></h1>
      <p>
        Okay, we now should have a clear understanding of what we're dealing with, and what the goal is: <u>escape the sandbox by exploiting the framework with the binary that we provide and then execute
        the <code>/senflag</code> binary to get the flag.</u><br>
        But the real question is: how on earth are we going to do that, after all, we're dealing with thousands of lines of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best approach to this is to try and divide this big chunk of code into smaller chunks. For example, a small chunk could be the <code>syscall</code> implementation.
        Qiling implemented quite a lot of system calls from all the supported operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The source code for this can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling/blob/master/qiling/os/posix/syscall/fcntl.py">https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling/blob/master/qiling/os/posix/syscall/fcntl.py</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's have a look at <code>ql_syscall_openat(ql: Qiling, fd: int, path: int, flags: int, mode: int)</code>
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <img src="assets/img/rwctf8.PNG" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <code>openat</code> is a systemcall that "operates in exactly the same way as <b>open(2)</b>" except for a few differences:
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the pathname given in <i>pathname</i> is relative, then it is interpreted relative to the directory referred to by the file descriptor <i>dirfd</i> (rather than relative to the current working 
              directory of the calling process, as is done by <b>open(2)</b> for a relative pathname).
            </li>
            <li>
              If the pathname given in <i>pathname</i> is relative and dirfd is the special value <b>AT_FDCWD</b>, then <i>pathname</i> is 
              interpreted relative to the current working directory of the calling process (like <b>open(2)</b>).
            </li>
            <li>
              ❗ If the pathname given in <i>pathname</i> is absolute, then <i>dirfd</i> is ignored. ❗
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Quickly looking at the function line by line, we can see that it first reads the <code>file_path</code> , sets the <code>flags & mode</code>
            and then iterates over the <code>fd</code> array to find an empty slot which is stored in <code>idx</code>. On success, 
            a few checks are performed which eventually will bring us to line no. 108. Here we can see that the function <code>open_ql_file</code> is called and <code>dir_fd</code> is passed to it.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <center><img src="assets/img/rwctf9.PNG" style="width:70%"></center><br>
      <p>
        Inside the <code>open_ql_file</code> function, there is a check on the parameter <code>path</code> (file_path)
        to see if it has_mapping, that basically means if the file is already opened. On contrary, the functions checks if <code>dir_fd</code> parameter is set (not null)
        and then execute: <code>ql_file.open</code> -> <code>open(real_path, openmode)</code> 💡
      </p>
      <p>
        Now this is very interesting. In a nutshell, if we call openat with an existing file descriptor (let's say <code>1</code>) and the path to a file (let's say <code>/etc/passwd</code>)
        we will be able to create a <code>fd</code> to the file and read / write from / to it without being restricted by the Qiling's rootfs.
      </p>


      <!-- EXPLOITATION -->
      <h1><i class="fas fa-bomb"></i> <span>&lt;EXPLOITATION&gt;</span></h1>
      <p>
        Let's test what we've just discovered:
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <img src="assets/img/rwctf10.PNG" style="width:100%">
          <br><br>
          <p>
            We will call the <code>openat</code> function (which underneath will invoke the <i>openat</i> syscall). Will set the <code>file_path</code>
            to <i>/etc/passwd</i>, the <code>flags</code> to <i>O_RDONLY</i> and <code>dir_fd</code> to <b>1</b>. And voilà, we are able to read 
            the contents of <code>file_path</code> although the specified file does not belong to the <code>rootfs</code>. 
          </p>
          <p style="font-size:155%">
            #🆂🅰🅽🅳🅱🅾🆇🅴🆂🅲🅰🅿🅴 💣
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <img src="assets/img/rwctf11.PNG" style="width:100%">
        </div>
      </div>  
      <p>
        Okay now, we've proven our hypothesis. We have the great ability to read and write into files we have permission to. What would
        be a responssible way of using it?
      </p>
      <h4>
        👉 <code>/proc/self/maps</code>
      </h4>
      <p>
        What is this file you might ask? Oh well, let's have a look at it:
      </p>
      <center><img src="assets/img/rwctf12.PNG" style="width:70%"></center>
      <br>
      <p>
        As we can see, each row basically describes a region of contiguous virtual memory of the current process (in my case /bin/sh). We can see the <code>address</code> (the starting and ending
        address of the region in the process's address space). The <code>permissions</code> (this describes how pages in the region can be accessed - r/w/x). <code>offset</code>, <code>inode</code>,
         <code>pathname</code> (if the region was mapped from a file, this is the name of the file, otherwise, the name of some special regions like heap/stack/vvar/vdso).
        Let's try reading this file through our exploit: 
      </p>
      <center><img src="assets/img/rwctf13.PNG" style="width:70%"></center>
      <br>
      <p>Alright, dope! What next tho? Well, now that we know where the python binary is located, and where the executable region is <code>0x00423000</code>, all we have to do is to overwrite part of it with a shellcode that will 
        spawn a shell 🙂
      </p>
      <p>
        How are we gonna do that?  
      </p>
      <h4>
        👉 <code>/proc/self/mem</code>
      </h4>
      <p> 
        "This file can be used to access the pages of a process's memory through open(2), read(2), and lseek(2)." <br>
        This is a very popular and powerful trick to bypass write protections for memory pages. 
        What exactly should we look to overwrite in this case? The options are endless, but I decided that it would be very easy
        to simply overwrite the PLT trampoline located at offset <code>+0x20</code> . Let's put this all together:
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <img src="assets/img/rwctf14.PNG" style="width:100%">

         <p>
           I believe this was a very nice challenge. The exploitation process was not hard at all, it just involved a bit of creativity,
           however, finding the vulnerability was a bit of a challenge.
         </p>
         <p>
           Meanwhile, the vulnerability has been patched: <a href="https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling/commit/6d0fc4a81880abc2984552ccd23497d8832d00fe">https://github.com/qilingframework/qiling/commit/6d0fc4a81880abc2984552ccd23497d8832d00fe</a>
         </p>
         <p>
           A fun fact about the CTF is that for every solved challenge, they rewarded the team with a token specific to the category: <a href="https://opensea.io/FetchDEX">see Profile</a>
